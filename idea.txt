We have to take in a directory of images
Then run the chess board locating model on them
crop them if there is an image, drop it if there isnt (also if it isn't roughly a square)
Drop the cropped images into a new folder
run the chess piece model on those
take the chess piece to be what 1/8th of the board it's in
and then output a FERN for chess.com
